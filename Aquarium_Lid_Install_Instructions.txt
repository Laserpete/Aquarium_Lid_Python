		Aquarium Lid Installation
**************************************************************

1. Take a micro SD card

2. Burn a new image of Raspian Lite onto it

3. In the boot partition of the SD card, create a file called "ssh". Lower case, no file extension.
This will enable SSH from first boot. The Pi will delete the file once it has changed the setting.

4. In the rootfs partition of the SD card, navigate to /etc/wpa_supplicant.

5. Open wpa_supplicant.conf in an editor, add the following lines, and enter your WiFi information

network={
ssid="WIFI_SSID"
psk="WIFI_PASSWORD"
}

The RasPi should now join your WiFi network on boot

6. Copy the file Aquarium_Lid_Installer.sh to the /home/pi directory

**************************************************************
7. Put the SD card in the RasPi, turn it on, log in over SSH.

It will give you a warning about the remote host identification changing

8. Change the password on the Pi

9. Run sudo bash Aquarium_Lid_Installer.sh

It will update and upgrade so it will take quite some time

10. When prompted, enter your GitHub credentials

11. Wait for ages

12. When it is all done, sudo reboot, hope for the best
